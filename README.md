# Google-Play-Android-App-Analysis

Use pandas and plotly to explore the app ecosystem!

This module aims to compare android apps in the Google Play Store, which offers insight into the following: 

1. Competitive differences between app categories (e.g., Games, Lifestyle, Weather, Personalisation).
2. Which app category offers compelling opportunities based on its popularity.
3. Download trends for paid apps vs free apps.
4. Average prices for paid apps.
5. Which apps have the highest revenue.
6. How much paid apps will recoup their development costs based on their sales revenue.

Based on a tutorial from 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022 led by Dr. Angela Yu of The London App Brewery.
